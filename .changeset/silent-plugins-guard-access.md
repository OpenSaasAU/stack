Fix a plugin's `extendList()` silently overwriting a pre-existing list's operation-level access. Per ADR-0013, an extension that carries `access.operation` for an existing list now throws a config-time error naming the plugin and the list; the auth plugin no longer forwards its own access when extending a list an app already declared.
