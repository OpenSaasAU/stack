Validate field self-containment at config load instead of failing deep in generation

Core now exports `validateFieldConfig(field, fieldKey, listKey?)` and `validateConfigFields(config)` (plus the `FieldConfigValidationError` type). They check each field implements its generation contract — `getPrismaType`, `getTypeScriptType`, and `getZodSchema` (or `getPrismaRelation` for relationships; virtual fields skip `getPrismaType`) — and return structured per-field errors. `opensaas generate` runs this first and fails fast with a clear message naming the list, field, and missing method, rather than throwing an opaque stack trace mid-generation.
