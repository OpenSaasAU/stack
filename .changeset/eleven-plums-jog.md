Upgrade TypeScript to v7. `typescript` now resolves to the `@typescript/typescript6` compatibility shim (keeping the classic compiler API available for `typescript-eslint` and Next.js's build-time type-checking, neither of which support TS 7's restructured package yet), while `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` is bumped to 8.63.0 to match. The CLI's Node-build compiler step (ADR-0011) now shells out to `tsc` instead of the removed synchronous `Program` API, using its own pinned native TS 7 binary via a new `@typescript/native` dependency.
